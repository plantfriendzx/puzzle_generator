# puzzle_generator
generate 3 by 2 puzzles in rust with any image

put however many puzzles pieces u want on line 193 (let pieces = {number of pieces u want}f64)

Makes b spline curves based on start and endpoints. Basically just divides up the piece count into the middlemost factors, and subdivides the dimensions of the puzzle by the factors.

this is the first rust thing I've ever done besides hello world so please be nice
